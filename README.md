# Do you have open pull requests?
We have a bunch of repo's per team and we're anxious to know.. Do we, do we, do we have pull requests?

# requirements
Create a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/applications).

# install

    npm install -g pull-me-tender
    pull-me-tender

It will prompt you for your username and token. And for repos you want to see pull-requests for. Now in the future just run: `pull-me-tender`
